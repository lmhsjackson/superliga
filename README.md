# Superliga

Superliga (spanish for superleague) it's an app to easily manage the [AAGO](http://aago.org.ar/)  [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) monthly leagues.
It is also intended as an opensource project anyone can contribute to.

Some of the features for the first mvp are:

* Enter a match result
* See the league table
* CRUD of matches/players/leagues
* Upload game records (kifus).
* Login/logout and admin capabilities.

Things on the wishlist are:

* Player profile: pics, statistics, rank history graph.
* Filtered match search (multiple filters)
* View records on embedded board (gokibitz or similar)

This app may evolve into a separate frontend in a js framework in the future, but for now will be a monolithic app.
