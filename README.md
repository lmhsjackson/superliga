# Superliga

Superliga (spanish for superleague) it's an app to easily manage our go monthly leagues.
It is also intended as an opensource project anyone can contribute to.

Some of the features for the first mvp are:

* Enter a match result
* See the league table
* CRUD of matches/players/leagues
* Upload game records (kifus).
* Login/logout and admin capabilities.

Things on the wishlist are:

* Player profile: pics, statistics, rank history graph.
* Filtered match search (multiple filters)
* View records on embedded board (gokibitz or similar)

This app may evolve into a separate frontend in a js framework in the future, but for now will be a monolithic app.
